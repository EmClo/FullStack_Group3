          1. If walking by yourself, get off your cell phone. A lot of people
          think that being on the phone is safe because the person on the other
          line can call 911, but that rarely works out. Chatting can distract
          you; it's better to be aware of your surroundings. That saidâ€¦ 2. If
          walking by yourself, hold your cell phone and be ready to make an
          emergency call. Many phones now have a button on the screen to dial
          911 immediately. Go one step further and preset one of the buttons on
          your phone to call the emergency number. 3. Look underneath your car
          before approaching it in a parking garage or lot at night 5. You
          return to your car and it has a flat tire. Back away. Return to
          wherever you came from (restaurant, store, etc) and call for help.
          Once assistance arrives, approach your car. If someone comes up to you
          (even if they are a woman) and wants to offer help, politely say, "No
          thank you." If a man, he could be a predator. If a woman, she could be
          the lurer. 17. When going out with your girlfriends, decide beforehand
          that you will stick together. Do not let your friend go off alone with
          a guy. 20. Don't check-in on Foursquare or Facebook when you arrive
          somewhere. Instead, check in as you leave. This way no one will be
          able to digitally stalk you and know your every move or when you're
          not home. Along the same lines, avoid tweeting or Facebooking from
          vacation, especially if your account is public, as it's a way of
          letting the world know that your home is unoccupied.
